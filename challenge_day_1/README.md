# Challenge day

Today you’re going to face your first challenge day, which is a day where you’re asked to build a completely new app from scratch using what you’ve learned so far. This might come as a surprise to you, because you may well think you haven’t learned that much so far. Well, let me explain…

The 100 Days of SwiftUI is the second 100 Days curriculum I’ve written, and while I know the original 100 Days of Swift was extremely popular and helped a lot of people, I definitely felt afterwards “if I were to do it all again, here’s what I’d change…”

One of those things was going back and adding more virtual chats to the initial Swift days, to help folks really make the most of those fundamentals. But the second change is one you’re meeting today: I want to get you writing your own projects faster.

In the original 100 Days folks completed the first project, then the second, then the third, and only then were asked to write their own app from scratch. While that worked well enough, I realized in retrospect that going on to a second and third project without really having solidified the basics wasn’t ideal.

And that brings us to today: your first challenge day, where you’re going to build a complete app from scratch. Don’t worry: this project has specifically been chosen based on what you’ve learned so far, so everything you need to know was covered already in project 1.
