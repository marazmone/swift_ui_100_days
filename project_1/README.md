# Project 1(WeSplit)

In this project we’re going to be building a check-splitting app that you might use after eating at a restaurant – you enter the cost of your food, select how much of a tip you want to leave, and how many people you’re with, and it will tell you how much each person needs to pay.

This project isn’t trying to build anything complicated, because its real purpose is to teach you the basics of SwiftUI in a useful way while also giving you a real-world project you can expand on further if you want.

You’ll learn the basics of UI design, how to let users enter values and select from options, and how to track program state.
